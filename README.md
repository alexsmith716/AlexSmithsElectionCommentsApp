Alex Smith's Election App 2016!
==============

This is one of my larger projects that I started right before the 2016 general election, though parts of it are from earlier work.

The project's stack is Mongo, Express, Node, Bootstrap, JQuery and Javascript. It works through alot of stuff including sessions, cookies, Mongoose, models, schema's, JSON, encryption, authentication, middleware, template engines, mixins, modules, error-handling, REST API, HTML5, CSS, csrf, session-fixation attacks, cross-site scripting, https, response & request, and always understanding & minding Node's single-threaded server (maintaining asynchronous operations & nonblocking code). Order of operations & modules is very important!

With all projects I am always trying to write concise, readable, efficient, reusable code and sticking to the DRY (don't repeat yourself) approach to programming. However, right now I am purposely writing my own code (possibly repeating myself) for some stuff and forgoing available modules. A great amount can be learned by solving something on your own. An example would be the client/server validation I wrote. There are module/plugins out there for validation (jQuery has a client side validation plugin and NPM offers several client/server validators) but I decided to create my own. I did get some general ideas from other sites along the way, but it's a tough one to master and you will need study for it.

The app is still a work in progress but I can finally see the end of the tunnel (I still need to finish validation, error-handling, Mongoose pagination, finalizing the CSS/HTML/Bootstrap and decide whether to use a preprocessor). Right now I am SUPER tempted to jump ship on this as is and move it into Angular or React.

I am not the perfect developer and never will be. I am always learning and improving my skills but I enjoy that process as much as the actual work itself. I know something can be solved, I just have to stay focused and quickly figure out how to solve it. There is a huge amount to learn in the booming world of Javascript these days but it simply means the opportunities and possibilities are well worth the effort.
